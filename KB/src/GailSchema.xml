        <data datum = "d2">History of respiratory problems:  During her second year, J.B. developed a chronic cough and has had frequent upper respiratory infections. </data>

        <data datum = "d6">J.B.'s 5-year old brother B.B. was diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis.</data>
        <generalizations gen = "g1">Cystic fibrosis is the name of a disease caused by having two mutated copies of the CFTR gene.  When both copies of CFTR are mutated, it cannot perform its normal function. </generalizations>
        <generalizations gen = "g2">People with CFTR gene dysfunction often have viscous secretions in the lungs, which provides a medium for growth of bacteria, and which may result in frequent respiratory infections.</generalizations>
        <generalizations gen = "g3">Dysfunction of CFTR may affect the pancreas. Pancreatic abnormality may result in malnutrition and poor growth.</generalizations>
        <generalizations gen = "g4">Cystic fibrosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that an individual with cystic fibrosis inherited two mutated copies of the CFTR gene: one from the mother and one from the father.</generalizations>
        <generalizations gen = "g5">If one parent is a carrier (has one copy of the mutation) and the other parent has no copies of the mutation, each offspring has a 25 percent  chance of being a carrier.</generalizations>
        <generalizations gen = "g6">Although cystic fibrosis classically manifests in early childhood, approximately 4 percent of patients are diagnosed in adulthood.</generalizations>
        <generalizations gen = "g7">In the absence of functional CFTR, sweat has an increased sodium chloride content. Most patients with cystic fibrosis show an elevated level of sweat chloride (more than 60 mmol/L).</generalizations>
