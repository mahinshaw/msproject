        <generalizations gen = "g4">Cystic fibrosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that an individual with cystic fibrosis inherited two mutated copies of the CFTR gene: one from the mother and one from the father.</generalizations>

        <generalizations gen = "g7">In the absence of functional CFTR, sweat has an increased sodium chloride content. Most patients with cystic fibrosis show an elevated level of sweat chloride (more than 60 mmol/L).</generalizations>
