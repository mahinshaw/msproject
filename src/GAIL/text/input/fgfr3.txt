Give one argument for the hypothesis that A.C.'s mother has exactly 1 mutated copy of the FGFR3 gene that causes achondroplasia.
@
A.C.'s mother has exactly 1 mutated copy of the FGFR3 gene that causes achondroplasia.
A.C.'s mother does not have any mutated copies of the FGFR3 gene that causes achondroplasia.
A.C.'s father has exactly 1 mutated copy of the FGFR3 gene that causes achondroplasia.
A.C.'s father does not have any mutated copies of the FGFR3 gene that causes achondroplasia.
Either (but not both) A.C.'s mother or A.C.'s father has exactly 1 mutated copy of the FGFR3 gene that causes achondroplasia.

A.C. has been diagnosed as having achondroplasia due to having exactly 1 mutated copy of the FGFR3 gene.
A.C.'s father has no symptoms of achondroplasia.

Achondroplasia is the name of a disease caused by having exactly 1 mutated copy of the FGFR3 gene. When 1 copy is mutated, the gene cannot perform its normal function. When the FGFR3 gene cannot perform its normal function, a person with the mutation may have symptoms such as dwarfism.
Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that an individual with achondroplasia inherited 1 mutated copy of the FGFR3 gene, either from the mother or from the father.
