Arguments for and/or against diagnosis of patient's hearing loss due to GJB2 mutation
@
The patient's hearing loss is due to having two mutated alleles of the gene GJB2.
The patient's hearing loss is not due to having two mutated alleles of the gene GJB2.
The patient's mother has two mutated alleles of the gene GJB2.
The patient's mother has at least one mutated allele of the gene GJB2.

The patient has had severe hearing loss since birth. 
The patient has no other symptoms (is non-syndromic).
The patient's mother does not have hearing loss.
The patient's father does not have hearing loss.

The GJB2 gene encodes a member of the gap junction protein family (connexin 26), which facilitates communications between cells. When both copies of GJB2 are mutated, it cannot perform its normal function.
Connexin 26 is found particularly in the inner ear. When there is a lack of connexin 26, cellular communication in the inner ear is disrupted which causes hearing loss from birth. This is a common source of severe to profound childhood hearing loss.
Individuals with GJB2 mutations are nonsyndromic: other than hearing loss, no other symptoms are reported.
A carrier of an autosomal recessive condition is someone who has one mutated and one normal allele of a gene. A carrier is not usually affected by the condition but may pass the mutation to his or her offspring.  If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance that each offspring will inherit two copies of the mutation and thus be affected.
