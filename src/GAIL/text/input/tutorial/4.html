<h2>Tutorial Part IV:  How do I build an argument against a hypothesis?</h2>
<p>An argument against a hypothesis is built in the same way as an argument that is for (supports) a
	hypothesis, except that the label on the arrow has been changed to "con". To change an
	arrow from "pro" to "con" click on the polarity icon inside of the arrow's control box
	until the label changes.</p>
<p>To watch an argument against a claim being constructed, play the video below. In this
	example, the fact that the mother does not have hearing loss is evidence against the hypothesis
	that she has two mutated alleles of GJB2.</p>
