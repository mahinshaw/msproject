<h2>Tutorial Part I: Introduction to Screen</h2>
<p>
	The <b>top of the left-hand column</b> is labeled <b>Problem</b>. This area contains one or more
	problems for you to work on. To solve a problem you must create arguments for and/or against the
	hypothesis given in the problems. The sections beneath Problem contain components of arguments:
	<b>Hypotheses, Data from Medical Records,</b> and <b>Connections.</b> You can drag these into the
	<b>argument building workspace</b> to build an argument. These are described in more detail in
	the section, <i>How to build arguments.</i>
</p>
<p>
	The <b>argument building workspace</b> is the large white space in the center and right-hand
	side of the screen.  You can drag argument components from the left-hand column into this area
	to build arguments. It has scroll bars on the side and bottom to allow you to see the entire
	workspace. In addition, you may need to use the <b>toolbar in the upper right-hand side</b>
	of the workspace. It has the following tools:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <b>eraser icon</b> can be used to delete components of an argument from the workspace.</li>
	<li>The <b>& icon</b> can be used to create a link between two or more components that means
		that the linked components are conjoined (jointly necessary).</li>
	<li>The <b>light bulb</b> icon can be used to create a hypothesis in your own words instead of
		dragging one from the left-hand side of the screen.</li>
	<li>The <b>book icon</b> allows you to view a tutorial.</li>
	<li>The <b>arrow icon</b> can be used to submit your final answers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you forget what any of the icons is used for, you can move your mouse over it to see a
	tooltip.</p>

<p>Below the argument building workspace are two windows that provide different types of
	information:</p>

<ul>
<li>
	<p><b>Pedigree window:</b> The pedigree window shows the patient's pedigree: a diagram used in
		genetics to show inheritance. In a pedigree, females are symbolized by circles and males by
		squares. A horizontal line connects the mother and father. A vertical line from a couple
		leads to each child of the couple.</p>
	<p>Shading is used to depict the number of copies of a gene mutation (0, 1, or 2) that a family
		member has in his or her cells. (Remember that everyone has two copies of each gene.) A
		question mark in a circle or rectangle means that the number is currently unknown. A circle
		or rectangle that is completely shaded represents having two mutated copies of a gene. Half
		shading represents having one mutated copy (and one normal copy) of a gene. No shading
		represents having no mutated copies (two normal copies) of a gene.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Workspace description:</b> By clicking on the <b>Refresh icon </b> (circular arrow) in the
	upper right-hand corner of this window, you can see a description in English of the arguments
	that are currently in the workspace. If you change the workspace, you can click on Refresh
	again.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Chat:</b> The chat window allows you to communicate with a teaching assistant who can answer
	your questions and give feedback if requested by you. Type your message in the area at the
	bottom of the chat window. Your messages and the assistant's replies will appear in the space
	above it.</p></li>
</ul>
