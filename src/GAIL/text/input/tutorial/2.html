<h2>Tutorial Part II:  What is an argument? How do I build a simple argument?</h2>
<p>In this learning environment, a simple argument for a claim has three parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <b>hypothesis:</b> the statement that is being argued for or against.</li>
<li>The <b>data:</b> information from the patient's medical record that is evidence for the
	hypothesis.</li>
<li>The <b>connection:</b> one or more pieces of general scientific or medical information that
	relates the data to the hypothesis. Note: you can drag more than one block of information from
	the Connections section of the screen and snap them together in the argument workspace</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, suppose the problem is to build an argument for the hypothesis: "The cause of the
	patient's hearing loss is due to having two mutated alleles of the gene called GJB2."  To watch
	this argument being constructed with the tools you have in this learning environment, play the
	video below.</p>
