<h2>Tutorial Part VI:  How do I build a chain of arguments?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you may need to "chain" two or more arguments together, when there is no data that you
	can use to directly support your hypothesis. For example, suppose you want to support the
	hypothesis that the patient's mother has one or two copies of the gene called GJB2 (i.e. one
	normal and one mutated copy, or two mutated copies) in all of her cells.</p>

<p>You could start by arguing from the hypothesis that the patient has two mutated copies of GJB2
	since the patient must have inherited one of the mutated copies from her mother.  However, you
	must now give an argument (a "subargument") for the hypothesis that the patient has two mutated
	copies of GJB2. You could give an argument for that based on the patient's symptoms of
	GJB2-related hearing loss.</p>

<p>To see how to connect the subargument to the first argument, play the video below.</p>
