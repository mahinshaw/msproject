<h2>Tutorial Part III:  How do I build an argument using more than one data element?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you may need to conjoin, or combine, two pieces of <b>Data</b> in an argument. For
	example, suppose that you want to use these connections:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The GJB2 gene encodes a member of the gap junction protein family (connexin 26), which
		facilitates communications between cells. When both copies of GJB2 are mutated, it cannot
		perform its normal function.</li>
	<li>Connexin 26 is found particularly in the inner ear. When there is a lack of connexin 26,
        cellular communication in the inner ear is disrupted which causes hearing loss from birth.
        This is a common source of severe to profound childhood hearing loss.</li>
	<li>Individuals with GJB2 mutations are nonsyndromic: other than hearing loss, no other symptoms
		are reported.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is that these connections are only true of hearing loss that is both severe-to-profound
	and non-syndromic. Thus, the argument must relate two pieces of evidence to the claim:</p>

<ul>
<li>The hearing loss is severe-to-profound, AND</li>
<li>The hearing loss is non-syndromic.</li>
</ul>
