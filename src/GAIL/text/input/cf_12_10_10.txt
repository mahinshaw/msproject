Patient: J.B., a 2-year old girl.
History of poor growth:  During infancy, J.B. had diarrhea and colic. According to a recent physical examination, her weight and height plotted less than the 3rd percentile.
History of respiratory problems:  During her second year, J.B. developed a chronic cough and has had frequent upper respiratory infections.
J.B.'s mother does not have a history of poor growth or respiratory problems.
J.B.'s father does not have a history of poor growth or respiratory problems.
J.B.'s brother is 15 years old.
J.B.'s brother does not have a history of poor growth or respiratory problems.
Test result:  J.B.'s chloride level is 75 mmol/L.
Ethnicity of mother:  N. European
Ethnicity of father:  N. European

Cystic fibrosis is the name of a disease caused by having two mutated copies of the CFTR gene in each cell.  When both copies of CFTR are mutated, it cannot perform its normal function.
The viscous secretions in the lungs of patients with CFTR dysfunction provide a medium for growth of bacteria, which may result in frequent respiratory infections.
Dysfunction of CFTR may affect the pancreas. Pancreatic abnormality may result in malnutrition and poor growth.
Cystic fibrosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that an individual with cystic fibrosis inherited two mutated copies of the CFTR gene: one from the mother and one from the father.
A carrier of an autosomal recessive gene is someone who has one mutated and one normal copy of the gene. Since one copy is normal, the carrier is not usually affected by the mutation, but may pass the mutated copy to an offspring.
If both parents are carriers, each offspring has a 25 percent chance of inheriting two copies of the mutation and being affected by the condition.
If one parent has the genetic condition (has two mutated copies of the gene) and the other parent is a carrier, each offspring has a 75 percent chance of inheriting two copies of the mutation and being affected by the condition.
If one parent is a carrier and the other parent has no copies of the mutation, each offspring has a 25 percent  chance of being a carrier.
Among North Americans who do not have a family history of cystic fibrosis (i.e. no children or other relatives with cystic fibrosis) and are of northern European ancestry, the chance of being a carrier (having one normal and one mutated copy of the CFTR gene) is approximately 1 in 25 (4 percent).
Although cystic fibrosis classically manifests in early childhood, approximately 4 percent of patients are diagnosed in adulthood.
In the absence of functional CFTR, sweat has an increased sodium chloride content. Most patients with cystic fibrosis show an elevated level of sweat chloride (more than 60 mmol/L).
